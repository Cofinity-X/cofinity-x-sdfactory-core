# Arc 42 Self Description Factory

## Introduction and Goals

SD-Factory creates a Verifiable Credential based on the information taken from OS, unlocks Private Key from CX-wallet 
and signs it with CatenaX key.

The self description factory is a factory to create Self Descriptions for two entities of
[TrustFramework v.22.04](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/-/tree/22.04), namely:
- LegalEntity
- ServiceOffering

## Requirements Overview

### High Level Requirements for Release 1


*   Create Self-Descriptions formed on information from the Onboarding Service
*   Unlock a Private Key from CX-Wallet
*   Sign Self-Description with CatenaX key

### High Level Requirement for Release 2

*   Creation of LegalPerson for each company
*   Creation of Service Offering
*   Provide API interface exclusively for the Portal
*   Provide signed SD document
*   Store SD documents

### High Level Requirements for Release 3

*   validate compliance of created SD documents using GX Compliance Service
*   Trust-Anchor of wallet is an eiDAS trust anchor

### Non-functional requirements

*   The SD Factory will have to be: accessible, easy to use, secure, efficient etc.

## Architecture Constraints

### Self Description Data Model

The data model of Gaia-X is not finally defined yet, but is a livid document with permanent changes. The latest 
information are available [here](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/participant/#provider).
Therefore, it was aligned with Gaia-X that the Self Descriptions' claims contain a small set of properties such as

Version 0.1 (October 2021 as mentioned in a Workshop together with Pierre Gronlier)

*   service\_name: the service provider (Operating Company)
*   service\_provider: the service provider (Operating Company) 
*   product\_provider: the product provider (the company providing this service): For shared services this will be Catena-X or the operating company in the name of Catena-x. 
*   governance\_law\_country: the service provider

Version 1.0 (based on the [Trust-Framework](https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/participant/#provider))

* company\_number: Country’s registration number which identify one specific company.
* headquarter.country: Physical location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* legal.country: Legal location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* service.provider: a `provider`‘s URL which provide the service
* bpn: the business partner id

For Catena-X release 2.0 we aligned with GAIA-X to adhere to
[Trustframework v22.04](https://confluence.catena-x.net/download/attachments/25223149/Gaia-X-Trust-Framework-22.04.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1658315527264&api=v2), 
thus providing self descriptions for

*   Legal person
*   Service offering
*   Data exchange connector service

**LegalPerson**

* **registrationNumber**: Country’s registration number which identify one specific company.
* **headquarterAddress.country**: Physical location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.
* **legalAddress.country**: Legal location in [ISO 3166-1](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)
  alpha2, alpha-3 or numeric format.

additional attributes for Catena-X purpose

*   bpn: the business partner id

**ServiceOffering**

* **providedBy:** a resolvable link to the participant self-description providing the service (see SD LegalPerson)
* **termsAndConditions**: a resolvable link to the Terms and Conditions applying to that service
* **policies**: a list of policy expressed using a DSL (Rego or ODRL)
* **aggregationOf:** (optional) a resolvable link to the resources self descriptions related to the service and that
  can exist independently of it.

**TermsAndConditions structure**

*   URL: a resolvable link to the document
*   hash: sha256 hash of the above document

### GX-Compliance Service

GAIA-X will also provide a service to proof for compliant self descriptions 
([https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance)).


## System Scope and Context

The Portal provides the necessary information to the SD Factory in plain text format via
API. SD-Factory creates the Jason-LD document signed by the wallet and provides it to the 
Portal.

## Business Context

## Technical Context

The following pictures show the relevant conceptual model with the entities of interest. For organizations, we do not
have to consider Natural Persons, but only Legal Persons. Each of these entities does have some mandatory but also some
optional attributes.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Resource <|-- PhysicalResource
    Resource <|-- VirtualResource
    Resource <|-- InstantiatedVirtualResource
    Resource o-- Resource
    Resource o-- ServiceOffering
    ServiceOffering --> Participant : providedBy
    Participant <|-- LegalPerson
    Participant <|-- NaturalPerson  
```
  
To get them filled we provide a service factory. Hence we have a subclassing hierarchy. 
The abstract instance provides the general feature to get things signed, either a part of the self-description or 
the whole self-description. In both cases, a string in JSON-LD format is passed to a wallet and gets signed by 
its private key and will be returned as String as signed JSON-LD.

```mermaid

	end
	
```

We reduced the mandatory attributes according to 
[TrustFramework v.22.04](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/policy-rules-committee/trust-framework/-/tree/22.04) 
and needed attributes for Catena-X.

## Solution Strategy

### The process for creating SD-Documents:

#### Step 1: Creation of LegalPerson for each company
*   Each SME or Company has to have an SD-Document. This SD document has to be created during the onboarding process.
*   It means concretely we have to create the LegalPerson for each company:
    *   SMEs,
    *   Enterprises,
    *   and Third-Party Provider

Example LegalPerson

![](images/image4.png)

*   The SD-Document of the company's LegalPerson will be signed by the Catena-X Wallet.

#### Step 2: Creation of PhysicalResource for the place where the service (e.g. connector) will running

* Each service need a data center or cloud ctenant where the service will be deployed this is the Physical 
  resource of the service
* the PhysicalResource contains a list of Participant who maintaining the service and the location (country)

Example PhysicalResource:

![](images/image5.png)

The Physical Resource will be created by the operator of the service (connector). The operator will use his wallet 
to sign this SD-Document.

#### Step 3: Creation of Service Offering and InstantiatedVirtualResource for each connector:

*   Pre assumptions:
    *   SD-Document: LegalPerson of connector operator is already existing
    *   SD-Document: PhsicalResource of the Connector is already existing
*   creation of InstantiatedVirtualResource for each connector
*   creation of ServiceOffering for each connector

![](images/image6.png)

*   The SD-Document of the connector will be signed by the Company Wallet (e.g. T-Systems wallet).

POST /selfdescription

Endpoint consumes JSON data (so, header Content-Type should be application/json) and returns JSON-LD.  
Note: Each request should contain holder and issuer fields and also type field (that is type of document, 
i.e. for LegalPerson it will be LegalPerson).  
  
Sample data for LegalPerson:

    {
      "registrationNumber": "123456",
      "headquarterAddress.country": "DE",
      "legalAddress.country": "DE",
      "bpn": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
      "issuer": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
      "holder": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
      "type": "LegalPerson"
    }


Sample data for ServiceOffering:

    {
      "providedBy": "https://<link_to_participant_self_description>",
      "aggregationOf": "https://<link_to_resource_self_description>",
      "termsAndConditions": "https://<link_to_terms_and_conditions>",
      "issuer": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
      "holder": "CAXSDUMMYCATENAZZ",
      "type": "ServiceOffering"
    }
    

##SD-Documents for Release 2:

In agreement with Portal, we will only create the LegalPerson SD-Document for CX-Participants and ServiceOffering for Connector

**CX-Release 2.0 (to be discussed with Portal-Team whether this reduces the amount of work or not for first step)**

> Proof, whether SD-Hub is able to provide a resolvable link to a registered SD artifact, e.g like _**[https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz](https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz)**_
>
> If this is possible, everything is fine and in the dialog this resolvable link had to be provided.
>
> If this is not possible, wenn instead of providing the link, we had to provide the data separated by semicolons for each attribute provided within the linked SD artifact.
>
> Example for this modified linking:
>
> Sample data for ServiceOffering:
> 
> instead of   
> providedBy="_**[https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz](https://sdhub.catena-x.de/sd?bpn=xyz)**_"  
we send

##Building Block View

##Runtime View

![](images/image8.png)

Here the flow of Self-Description creation is shown:

1. A user is authenticated in Identity Provider service on behalf of a company and receives the authentication ticket.
2. User calls Onboarding Service with request for creating and publishing SD-document. The service authenticates the user
   and prepare the data SD-Factory needs for creating SD-document such as: company\_number, headquarter.country and legal.country.
   **The ID (DID) of the user shall be known at this point of time as SD-document consist of Verifiable Credentials (VC)
   issued for a holder of a DID. This means that the Organisation wallet is already available.** The nature of that ID 
   is not very important for the SD-hub, the only requirement is that it shall be resolvable to a DID document. It can be 
   a regular http URL even.
3. Onboarding service (OS) calls SD-Factory for creating and publishing SD-document passing this data as a parameter.
   OS uses a credential with a role allowing for this request (e.g. ROLE\_SD\_CREATOR). The credential for this operation
   is taken from ID Provider (keyclock).
4. SD-Factory creates a Verifiable Credential based on the information taken from OS, unlocks Private Key from 
   Organisation-wallet (custodian wallet), and signs it with organization key.
5. SD-Factory publishes the Verifiable Credential to the Portal. As the VC is signed with a trusted key the endpoint for
   publishing at the Portal may be publicly accessible. SD document is not stored in SD-Factory.
